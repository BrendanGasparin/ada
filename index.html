    <p>Ada Lovelace is recognised as the world's first computer programmer.</p>
    <p>Born Augusta Ada Byron in 1815, Ada was the only child to the Romantic poet Lord George Byron and his wife Anne Isabella Milbanke.</p>
    <p>Lord Byron was surrounded by rumours of infidelity and even incest. Milbanke left him weeks after Ada was born, taking Ada with her, and a few months later Lord Byron left England forever.</p>
